I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the three principal investigators who have guided me over the past three years. My deepest thanks go to Marc Teyssier for his invaluable support and mentorship during my UROP year, as well as to Clément Duhart and Xiao Xiao for their guidance and assistance throughout these two years of my master’s program.

I am also deeply grateful to my classmates and friends for making these two years unforgettable. A special thanks to Hugo Devoille and Paul Even, as well as to Noé Guennoun, Nicolas Leboucher, Yohann Cossez, Marc-Adrien, and many others who have been part of this journey.

Lastly, I would like to thank my professors and researchers, including Yliess, Grégor, Thomas Juldo, Paul-Peter, and Madalina, for their unwavering support and the time they dedicated to teaching us. Their efforts have equipped us with the comprehensive knowledge and skills in engineering and research, preparing us to face future challenges with confidence.
