\section{Introduction}



In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), this study delves into the nascent field of human-plant interaction, as envisioned by the Internet of Plant project. This innovative initiative explores the potential intersections between human actions and botanical entities to create a symbiotic relationship between nature and technology. The central inquiry involves imagining a future where plants respond acoustically to physical touch. Three distinct plant species—Dypsis lutescens, Pachira glabra, and Dracaena—are employed as subjects to examine user perceptions and interactions within this imagined framework. The objective is to contribute to the discourse surrounding the integration of technology and nature by discerning the various ways in which individuals conceptualize and interact with plants as potential musical collaborators.
