\section*{Abstract}
\textit{This thesis explores the integration of sound-based artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) to develop interactive systems for environmental monitoring, emotional expression, and immersive learning. The first project uses machine learning to classify bird species through vocalizations, contributing to accessible bioacoustic monitoring. The second project develops an emotionally adaptive text-to-speech (TTS) system, enhancing human-computer interaction with lifelike emotional expressions. The final project combines TTS and AR in a theater training platform, enabling students to interact with virtual characters and receive real-time feedback. These projects demonstrate the potential of AI and AR to transform human-computer interaction in conservation, education, and performance arts..}
