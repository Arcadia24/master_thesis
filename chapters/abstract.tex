\section*{Abstract}


\textit{This master's thesis explores the transformation of plants into bio-sensors, using their natural sensing capabilities to capture and interpret human-plant interactions. The research introduces a system where data from plants is used to generate real-time auditory feedback, creating a novel sound-based interaction mechanism. Additionally, the project extends this concept by developing a network of interconnected plant-based sensors, enabling distributed interaction and monitoring. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using plants as interactive bio-sensors, showing potential applications in human-computer interaction and bio-sensing. This work opens new possibilities for sustainable, plant-integrated technologies in both environmental and artistic contexts.}
