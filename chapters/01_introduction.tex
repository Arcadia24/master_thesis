\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background motivation}

I am an creative technology engineer that is passionate about embedded systems and 
their hardware/software architecture.
Pushed by my principal investigator and eager to take on challenges, I wanted to 
explore the intersection of biology and electronics. 
I aim to transform plants into bio-sensors, using their natural sensing capabilities to 
capture the human-plant interaction. Extending the capacities of a single plant, I want to create a network of 
plant-based sensors. 

I am also interested in the use of sensor data. With no particular appetence for musical creation, 
my principal investigator challenged me onto create a device that can use the data from the plant 
and generate sound based on interaction. The musical generation allows the plant to be listened to and to \hl{care
about it.}

\subsection{Research domain}

Research domains on the human-plant interaction are wide. The HCI\footnote{Human Computer Interface} field is focused
during this master thesis. HCI gather all the technologies that allows human to interact with computer.
However, it usually only is a new way of interaction, there the plant is a living component that brings its 
own sensibility and needs (watering, lighting...).

The sensor making and creation field is also focused. In this master thesis plants are transformed into sensor.
This transformation...
