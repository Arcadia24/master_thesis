This equipment can be also suitable for teaching various subjects such as Music, Computer Science and Engineering. The outcome of this research is not an amazing controller or a brandy new cool interface but the experience of building a controller concerning all the bad conditions of doing it.},

Any sound file chosen from computer can be integrated in microcontroller programming which is written in C and compiled by AVR libc compiler. An 8 bit DAC connected to PORT A of AVR microcontroller takes data of sound file as input and gives converted analog sound signal as output. An audio amplifier based on LM386 Op-Amp circuit amplifies the sound signal which is finally connected to 8{\textohm} speaker for audible sound output. This circuit has been simulated using Proteus ISIS 7 Virtual System Modeling (VSM).},

  abstract = {Consumers have historically shown an inclination to purchase plants that enhance their quality of life, meaning they will purchase items that positively influence their social, physical, psychological, cognitive, environmental, and spiritual well-being. Plants in native and improved landscapes (and interiorscapes) have been documented to influence each of six quality of life constructs. This paper summarizes publications regarding the emotional and mental health benefits associated with plants, addressing reduced anxiety and stress, attention deficit recovery, fractals and visual response, decreased depression, enhanced memory retention, greater happiness and life satisfaction, mitigation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), increased creativity, enhanced productivity and attention, reduced effects of dementia, and improved self-esteem. This research should be strategically incorporated into both industry-wide and firm-specific marketing messages that highlight the quality of life value proposition in order to maintain the industry's sense of value and relevance to consumers of the future.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years, the physiological relaxing effect brought by nature is becoming clear; however, many workers find it difficult to be exposed to nature in their working environment. Exposure to fresh flowers represents an opportunity to incorporate nature into their working lives. In this study, we examined the effects of exposure to roses on physiological and psychological variables (heart rate variability, pulse rate, and subjective responses) in office workers. Results: The experimental site was Mizuho Information \& Research Institute, Inc., in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Thirty-one male office workers were included in the present study. The subjects were exposed to thirty unscented pink roses (Rosa, Dekora) arranged in a cylindrical glass vase for 4 min. In the control condition, the subjects were not exposed to flowers. After the experiments, the subjects completed a questionnaire. The order of exposure was counterbalanced among subjects. Among subjects exposed to roses, the high-frequency component of heart rate variability was significantly higher than in controls. Similarly, `comfortable,' `relaxed' and `natural' feelings were more common in subjects exposed to roses. Conclusions: Data from this study support the presence of physiological and psychological relaxing effects of being exposed to flowers on office workers.},
