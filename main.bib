  abstract = {Lack of access to technological devices is a common exponent of a new form of social exclusion. Coupled with this, there are also the risk of increasing inequality between developed and underdeveloped countries when concerning technology access. Regarding Internet access, the percentage of young Africans who do not have access to technology is around 60\%, while in Europe the figure is 4\%. This limitation also expands for musical instruments, whether electronic or not. In light of this worldwide problem, this paper aims to showcase a method for building a MIDI Controller, a prominent instrument for musical production and live performance, in an economically viable form that can be accessible to the poorest populations. This equipment can be also suitable for teaching various subjects such as Music, Computer Science and Engineering. The outcome of this research is not an amazing controller or a brandy new cool interface but the experience of building a controller concerning all the bad conditions of doing it.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we have proposed a technique by which customized sound can be generated using 8 bit AVR microcontroller. Any sound file chosen from computer can be integrated in microcontroller programming which is written in C and compiled by AVR libc compiler. An 8 bit DAC connected to PORT A of AVR microcontroller takes data of sound file as input and gives converted analog sound signal as output. An audio amplifier based on LM386 Op-Amp circuit amplifies the sound signal which is finally connected to 8{\textohm} speaker for audible sound output. This circuit has been simulated using Proteus ISIS 7 Virtual System Modeling (VSM).},
