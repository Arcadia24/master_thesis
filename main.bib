Any sound file chosen from computer can be integrated in microcontroller programming which is written in C and compiled by AVR libc compiler. An 8 bit DAC connected to PORT A of AVR microcontroller takes data of sound file as input and gives converted analog sound signal as output. An audio amplifier based on LM386 Op-Amp circuit amplifies the sound signal which is finally connected to 8{\textohm} speaker for audible sound output. This circuit has been simulated using Proteus ISIS 7 Virtual System Modeling (VSM).},

Plants in native and improved landscapes (and interiorscapes) have been documented to influence each of six quality of life constructs. This paper summarizes publications regarding the emotional and mental health benefits associated with plants, addressing reduced anxiety and stress, attention deficit recovery, fractals and visual response, decreased depression, enhanced memory retention, greater happiness and life satisfaction, mitigation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), increased creativity, enhanced productivity and attention, reduced effects of dementia, and improved self-esteem. This research should be strategically incorporated into both industry-wide and firm-specific marketing messages that highlight the quality of life value proposition in order to maintain the industry's sense of value and relevance to consumers of the future.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years, the physiological relaxing effect brought by nature is becoming clear; however, many workers find it difficult to be exposed to nature in their working environment. Exposure to fresh flowers represents an opportunity to incorporate nature into their working lives. In this study, we examined the effects of exposure to roses on physiological and psychological variables (heart rate variability, pulse rate, and subjective responses) in office workers. Results: The experimental site was Mizuho Information \& Research Institute, Inc., in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Thirty-one male office workers were included in the present study. The subjects were exposed to thirty unscented pink roses (Rosa, Dekora) arranged in a cylindrical glass vase for 4 min. In the control condition, the subjects were not exposed to flowers. After the experiments, the subjects completed a questionnaire. The order of exposure was counterbalanced among subjects. Among subjects exposed to roses, the high-frequency component of heart rate variability was significantly higher than in controls. Similarly, `comfortable,' `relaxed' and `natural' feelings were more common in subjects exposed to roses. Conclusions: Data from this study support the presence of physiological and psychological relaxing effects of being exposed to flowers on office workers.},

It discusses critical considerations (e.g. maintenance, reproducibility) for such interfaces, supported by a user study based on an interactive prototype. The results of our user study show that users' interest in plants varies significantly with past experience. Users may create a strong emotional bond with plants, suggesting that organic interfaces should be used for emotionally strong use cases, such as keeping in touch with loved ones or checking important data.},

  abstract = {Thigmonastic movements in the sensitive plant Mimosa pudica L., associated with fast responses to environmental stimuli, appear to be regulated through electrical and chemical signal transductions. The thigmonastic responses of M. pudica can be considered in three stages: stimulus perception, electrical signal transmission and induction of mechanical, hydrodynamical and biochemical responses. We investigated the mechanical movements of the pinnae and petioles in M. pudica induced by the electrical stimulation of a pulvinus, petiole, secondary pulvinus or pinna by a low electrical voltage and charge. The threshold value was 1.3--1.5 V of applied voltage and 2 to 10 mC of charge for the closing of the pinnules. Both voltage and electrical charge are responsible for the electro-stimulated closing of a leaf. The mechanism behind closing the leaf in M. pudica is discussed. The hydroelastic curvature mechanism closely describes the kinetics of M. pudica leaf movements.},

We demonstrate the rich capabilities of Touch{\'e} with five example setups from different application domains and conduct experimental studies that show gesture classification accuracies of 99\% are achievable with our technology.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for creating Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing with open source technology for use in creating richer and more complex musical gestures. This new style of capacitive touch sensing is extremely robust compared to older versions and will allow greater implementation of gesture recognition and touch control in the development of NIMEs. Inspired by the Touch{\'e} project, this paper discusses how to implement this technique using the community standard hardware Arduino instead of custom designed electronics. This sensing technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many conductive materials, even biological materials such as plants. This paper also introduces a new Arduino Library, SweepingCapSense, which simplifies the coding required to implement this technique. Lastly, this paper will discuss its use in the project known as Cultivating Frequencies.},
