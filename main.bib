  abstract = {Background: In recent years, the physiological relaxing effect brought by nature is becoming clear; however, many workers find it difficult to be exposed to nature in their working environment. Exposure to fresh flowers represents an opportunity to incorporate nature into their working lives. In this study, we examined the effects of exposure to roses on physiological and psychological variables (heart rate variability, pulse rate, and subjective responses) in office workers. Results: The experimental site was Mizuho Information \& Research Institute, Inc., in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Thirty-one male office workers were included in the present study. The subjects were exposed to thirty unscented pink roses (Rosa, Dekora) arranged in a cylindrical glass vase for 4 min. In the control condition, the subjects were not exposed to flowers. After the experiments, the subjects completed a questionnaire. The order of exposure was counterbalanced among subjects. Among subjects exposed to roses, the high-frequency component of heart rate variability was significantly higher than in controls. Similarly, `comfortable,' `relaxed' and `natural' feelings were more common in subjects exposed to roses. Conclusions: Data from this study support the presence of physiological and psychological relaxing effects of being exposed to flowers on office workers.},

The results of our user study show that users' interest in plants varies significantly with past experience. Users may create a strong emotional bond with plants, suggesting that organic interfaces should be used for emotionally strong use cases, such as keeping in touch with loved ones or checking important data.},

The thigmonastic responses of M. pudica can be considered in three stages: stimulus perception, electrical signal transmission and induction of mechanical, hydrodynamical and biochemical responses. We investigated the mechanical movements of the pinnae and petioles in M. pudica induced by the electrical stimulation of a pulvinus, petiole, secondary pulvinus or pinna by a low electrical voltage and charge. The threshold value was 1.3--1.5 V of applied voltage and 2 to 10 mC of charge for the closing of the pinnules. Both voltage and electrical charge are responsible for the electro-stimulated closing of a leaf. The mechanism behind closing the leaf in M. pudica is discussed. The hydroelastic curvature mechanism closely describes the kinetics of M. pudica leaf movements.},

This new style of capacitive touch sensing is extremely robust compared to older versions and will allow greater implementation of gesture recognition and touch control in the development of NIMEs. Inspired by the Touch{\'e} project, this paper discusses how to implement this technique using the community standard hardware Arduino instead of custom designed electronics. This sensing technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many conductive materials, even biological materials such as plants. This paper also introduces a new Arduino Library, SweepingCapSense, which simplifies the coding required to implement this technique. Lastly, this paper will discuss its use in the project known as Cultivating Frequencies.},

But most computer input devices cannot detect when the user touches or releases the device or some portion of the device. Thus, adding touch sensors to input devices offers many possibilities for novel interaction techniques. We demonstrate the TouchTrackball and the Scrolling TouchMouse, which use unobtrusive capacitance sensors to detect contact from the user's hand without requiring pressure or mechanical actuation of a switch. We further demonstrate how the capabilities of these devices can be matched to an implicit interaction technique, the On-Demand Interface, which uses the passive information captured by touch sensors to fade in or fade out portions of a display depending on what the user is doing; a second technique uses explicit, intentional interaction with touch sensors for enhanced scrolling. We present our new devices in the context of a simple taxonomy of tactile input technologies. Finally, we discuss the properties of touch-sensing as an input channel in general.},

We contribute a set of technical principles for the design of printable circuitry that makes the sensor more robust against cuts, damages and removed areas. This includes novel physical topologies and printed forward error correction. A technical evaluation compares different topologies and shows that the sensor remains functional when cut to a different shape.},

The IoT provides the acquired data from the environment to the Internet through the service providers. This further helps users to view the numerical or plotted data. In addition, it also allows objects which are located in long distances to be sensed and controlled remotely through embedded devices which are important in agriculture domain. Developing such a system for the IoT is a very complex task due to the diverse variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services. This paper proposes a practical approach to acquiring data of temperature, humidity and soil moisture of plants. In order to accomplish this, we developed a prototype device and an android application which acquires physical data and sends it to cloud. Moreover, in the subsequent part of current research work, we have focused towards a temperature forecasting application. Forecasting metrological parameters have a profound influence on crop growth, development and yields of agriculture. In response to this fact, an application is developed for 10 days ahead maximum and minimum temperatures forecasting using a type of recurrent neural network.},
